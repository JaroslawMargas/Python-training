# Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into n√óm portions. Chocolate bar can be split into two
# rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line on its pattern. Determine whether it is possible to
# split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.
#
# The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.
